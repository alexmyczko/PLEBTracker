\fBplebtrkraw\fR 
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBplebtrkraw\fR is the tracker program. It generally shouldn't be called directly by the user, instead \fBplebtrk\fR is called which starts the daemon and ties that daemon and this tracker together to enable audio playback\&.
.sp
If you do call this, pipe stderr somewhere otherwise it will go to the console and jumble the visual interface.
.sp
.SH "INTERFACE"
There are 5 windows in the tracker. To focus one, press TAB and then another key to switch.
Use arrow keys, HOME, END, PAGEUP, PAGEDN to maneuver.
.sp
Metadata Window (\fBTAB + q\fR)
    Contains song title, order list, instrument selection, and other fields used to control operation of the tracker and song playback.
.sp
Pattern Editor (\fBTAB + w\fR)

.sp
Volume Table (\fBTAB + a\fR)

.sp
Instrument Window (\fBTAB + s\fR)
    Change an instrument's wave table index or manage instruments.
.sp
Wave Table (\fBTAB + d\fR || \fBTAB + e\fR)

.sp
To edit a field, focus it and press ENTER. To cancel an edit, press TAB\&.
.sp
There are a couple of keybindings to keep in mind\&.
.sp
Change octaves quickly by holding shift and pressing the according number key (e.g. SHIFT+2 = Octave 1)

    The playback mark marks where automatic playback begins or ends\&.
.sp

.SH "COMMAND LINE"
