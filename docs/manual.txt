Thanks for checking out PLEBTracker! by Dan Frazier

Inspired by demoscene and older trackers I decided to begin this project
in January 2016. My goal for this was mostly just to get it to work as my
first audio program, and I wanted some experience writing an audio program.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/////////////////////       INTRODUCTION         //////////////////////////////

  --Using the interpreter
At this time PLEBTracker does not produce any sound, it produces a song (.plb)
file. PLEBInterpreter reads the song file and outputs the raw data of the 
interpretted song to stdout. To play the song you must have aplay (ALSA play)
or some equivalent and run "./PLEBInterpreter song.plb | aplay".

Update:
There is now a bashscript `plebtrk` that allows for playback within the tracker,
but I won't go into the details of that in this document, just know: run plebtrk,
not plebtrkraw.


  --Navigating the tracker
To select another window press TAB, then
 + q   | Metadata window
 + w   | Pattern editor
 + a   | Instrument Volume table
 + s   | Instrument window
 + e/d | Wave table
 + r/f | Pulse table

To change octave, hold SHIFT and press the number key according to the octave
e.g. SHIFT + 1 = Octave 1





  --Songs
Songs contain the following
fields:
  | Bytes Per Row
  | Inter-row Resolution
  | 
structures:
  | Pattern list
  | Order list
  | Wave table
  | Instrument list
  |

  BPR, Bytes per row determines the duration of one row in terms of bytes.

  DIV,`segments`, or `inter-row resolution` subdivides each row into multiple
  segments, which effectively controls how fast instruments progress on the
  wave table and volume table. The higher DIV gets, tracks iterate through the
  tables faster within the duration of a single row.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  --Pattern Editor
Patterns contain the data used to determine what notes are played by what
instruments at what time.

note
|   instrument
|   |  volume
|   |  |  effect
v   v  v  v
C-1 00 3F 303

[HOME]/[END]  focusses the prev/next track
[PGUP]/[PGDN] focusses 8 rows above/below

The max volume in the pattern editor is 0x3F.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  --Instrument
fields:
  | Wave index
  |
structures:
  | Volume table
  |

  An instrument's Wave index points to the index
  in the Wave table that this instrument corresponds to

  --Volume Table
  The volume table produces this instrument's volume envelope.

     volume
     |  segment duration 
     v  v
  00|VV DD|

  The first entry in the volume table is the initial volume and has no duration
  a volume of FF is reserved for jumps, so for instance a volume table like the following:

  00|3f 00|
  01|00 0F|
  02|10 01|
  03|06 01|
  04|FF 02|

  Would start out at 3F volume, decay to a volume of 0 after F segments,
  (see BPR/DIV.) then it will loop...
  02|10 01|
  03|06 01|
  forever, producing a Tremor effect

  FA to FF are reserved for functions,
  |FA XX| is Set Repeat, following volume entries will be repeated XX times before iterating
  |FB XX| is Set loop counter
  |FC XX| is Decrement loop counter, then jump if loop counter isn't 0
  |FF XX| is Jump

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  --Wave Table
  The wave table selects the sounds used by different instruments

        Waveform
        |  Semitone offset
        v  v
  |0000|WW TT|

  progressing semitone offsets can produce an arpeggio effect:
  |0000|01 00|
  |0001|01 04|
  |0002|01 07|
  |0003|FF 00|

  --Waveforms
  00 - Silence
  01 - Square (normal square)
  02 - Triangle
  03 - Saw
  04 - Sine
  05 - Random

  06 - Square (with duty)

    These are the basic waveforms, as of now there are around 32 waveforms
    all of which are detailed in the wavetable.pdf document.
The wave table also has functions:
  |FF XX| - Jump

  |FA XX| - Set Repeat, following wave entries will be repeated XX times before iterating
  |FB XX| - Set loop counter
  |FC XX| - Decrease loop counter, jump to location if loop counter != 0

  |FD XX| - Set custom jump location
  |FE XX| - Jump to custom jump location

  |F0 XX| - Set pulse/duty cycle
  |F1 XX| - Add to pulse/duty cycle

  Note, that the wave table has 0x10000 indicies and the jump command
  only goes from 00 to FF. To work around that, two adjacent FF or FD commands
  can be used to jump to a higher index.

  '>' signifies the entry point, where execution would begin (wave index)

 >|0000|01 00|
  |0001|FF 01| //jump to 0140
  |0002|FF 40|
  ...
  |0140|01 03|
  |0141|01 07|
  |0142|FF 00|

  FD command stores the provided index within a _track's_ parameters.
  This is very powerful because that makes "procedures" possible.
  Akin to a procedure in assembly programming.
  Take for example this pulse procedure

  Instrument with WaveIndex [0008]

  |0002|.. ..| //Run something here
  |0003|FE 00| //Jumps back to wherever custom jump was set 
  ...
  |0008|FD 08| //Set base to 08, instrument will return here after a procedure
  |0009|01 00| //play arpeggio
  |000A|01 03|
  |000B|01 07|
  |000C|FF 02|

  --IMPORTANT--
  Functions F0 - FF are evaluated instantly! So it is possible to make an
  infinite loop that will freeze or crash the interpreter.
  As long as a waveform is played, the wavetable won't get stuck.

  !] This is no longer entirely true. Now instead of an infinite loop, if the interpreter goes through
  upwards of some amount of jumps (64 wave function calls) it will give up and choose waveform 0, silence.

the [>] in these examples shows where the instrument enters the wave table

 >|0003|01 03| //Is safe
  |0004|FF 03|

 >|0003|FF 03| //Totally not safe

 >|0003|FD 20| //Also not safe, FD is instantaneous
  |0004|FF 03|

  |0001|01 00| //Is safe, but weird.
  |0002|FE 00|
 >|0003|FD 01|
  |0004|FF 01|

  --Pulse Table
  The pulse table modifies how waves that use the pulse parameter sound.

  The pulse table works a little bit differently than the wave table.
  Entries that begin with...
   [0 to 6] ADD to the pulse parameter.
   [7 to D] SUBTRACT fom the pulse parameter.
   [E]      Set the pulse parameter.
   [F]      Are functions.

        vv vv  
  |0000|XX XX|

Each track has two pulse parameters and they are the size of 16 bit integers [0000 to FFFF]
so for instance if you were to do

  |0000|E0 01| //then Pulse param 1 = 0010
  |0001|FB 0F| //Set loop counter to F 
  |0002|10 00| //Add 1000
  |0003|FC 02| //Jump to 2, adding 1000 until loop counter is 0
               //Pulse param 1 = F010

  Really, the best way to do pulse subtraction is to write in what number you want to be negative
  then press N. The number will be negated for you.
  BUT if you like making things harder for yourself, know that DFFF = -1 and D000 = -1000

The pulse table has the same jump functions as the wave table.

  |F0 XX| - Set Pulse Parameter 2 
  |F1 XX| - Add/Subtract Pulse Parameter 2 [00-7F/80-FF]
  |FA XX| - Set Pulse Repeat
  |FB XX| - Set Pulse loop Counter
  |FC XX| - Decrement Pulse loop counter, Jump to destination if it's > 0
  |FD XX| - Set custom jump location
  |FE XX| - Jump to custom jump location (offset by XX)
  |FF XX| - Jump to XX
